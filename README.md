# AMCAT Salary Analysis

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the AMCAT dataset to understand the salary trends, specializations, and skill sets of fresh graduates in various roles. The main focus is on analyzing the relationship between the claimed salary and the actual average salary for selected job roles.

## Objectives
- Analyze salary trends among different job roles.
- Examine the influence of educational specialization on salary.
- Investigate gender representation across various roles.
- Assess the correlation between skill sets and salary.
- Explore the impact of educational background on initial job placements.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Gender**: Categorical variable representing the gender of the individual.
- **Specialization**: The individual's field of study or specialization.
- **Job Role**: The position held by the individual (e.g., Programming Analyst, Software Engineer).
- **Salary**: Numerical variable representing the annual salary of the individual.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Filter the dataset for relevant job roles.
   - Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
   
2. **Statistical Testing**: 
   - Conduct a one-sample t-test to compare the actual average salary against the claimed mean salary for selected roles.
   
3. **Visualization**: 
   - Generate various plots to visualize distributions of salary, specialization, gender ratio, and job roles.
